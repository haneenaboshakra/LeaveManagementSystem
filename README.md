# Leave Management System

## Overview

This is a simple Leave Management System built using Laravel. It provides an interface for employees to submit leave requests, allows managers to approve or reject them, and provides admins with control over the leave requests and user management.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- PHP 8.x or later
- Composer
- Laravel 8.x or later
- MySQL or any relational database
- Node.js (for front-end assets)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

    Clone the project from the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/haneenaboshakra/LeaveManagementSystem.git
    cd leave-management-system
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    Run the following command to install PHP dependencies via Composer:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

    Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the database connection details:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Open the `.env` file and set your database credentials:

    ```ini
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=leave_management_system
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=
    ```

4. **Generate Application Key**

    Laravel requires an application key for secure hashing. You can generate it by running:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5. **Migrate the Database**

    Run the database migrations to set up the necessary tables:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

6. **Seed the Database**

    To populate the database with sample data (users, roles, and leave requests), run the seeding command:

    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

7. **Install Frontend Dependencies**

    If you're using Laravel Mix for assets (like CSS, JS), run the following commands:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

8. **Run the Application**

    You can now run the application using Laravel's built-in server:

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Architectural Choices

1. **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**:  
   The application follows the traditional **MVC architecture**:
   - **Models**: Represent the database structure and business logic (`User`, `LeaveRequest`, `Department`).
   - **Views**: Handle the UI and display data to the user using Blade templating.
   - **Controllers**: Act as intermediaries between models and views, containing the logic for handling requests (e.g., `EmployeeController`, `AdminController`,`ManagerController`).

2. **Role-based Access Control**:  
   The application uses the **Spatie Laravel Permission** package to manage user roles and permissions. There are three roles:
   - **Admin**: Do CRUD operations on Employees, handle leave requests.
   - **Manager**: Reviews leave requests from employees they manage.
   - **Employee**: Can create and view leave requests.
   - All of them are able to update there profile information.

3. **Leave Request System**:
   - Employees can create leave requests, which are then reviewed by their assigned manager.
   - Managers can approve or reject requests, and the status is updated accordingly.
   - Admins can view and manage all leave requests.

4. **Database Schema**:  
   - `users` table stores employee, manager, and admin details, department_id.
   - `leave_requests` table stores leave request information, such as leave type, dates, status, and the user/manager involved.
   - `departments` table stores department names.
   - The system uses **foreign keys** to associate leave requests with users and managers.

5. **Frontend**:  
   - Uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
   - **Blade Templates** handle UI rendering.

## Assumptions and Trade-offs

1. **Role-Based Design**:
   - The system assumes there are three user roles (admin, manager, employee) and each has its own set of permissions. This simplifies role management but does not account for a more complex hierarchical or permission-based model where roles might overlap or have more granular permissions.

2. **Leave Request Types**:
   - The system supports four predefined leave types: `sick`, `vacation`, `emergency`, and `other`. If thereâ€™s a need for more types, modifications are needed. This keeps the system simple but not very flexible for future extensions.

3. **No Multi-Tenancy**:
   - The system assumes a single company model, where one set of employees and managers exist within one database. In case multi-tenancy is required (supporting multiple companies), the system will need adjustments, such as introducing company-specific tables or databases.

4. **Basic Leave Approval Workflow**:
   - The leave approval workflow is kept simple: an employee submits a leave request, the manager approves or rejects it. There is no support for complex workflows like escalation or multiple levels of approval. Future enhancements may include such features if needed.

5. **Authentication & Security**:
   - The system uses Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (laravel breeze).
   - For simplicity, user passwords are stored securely using Laravel's default `Hash` system.

6. **Database Seeding for Testing**:
   - The seeding logic generates random data for users and leave requests. This is useful for development and testing, but it does not handle all edge cases (e.g., ensuring employees and managers are assigned appropriately).

---

## Conclusion

This Leave Management System provides a basic structure for managing employee leave requests, with different roles having specific permissions. It is built with simplicity in mind and is extendable to add more features as needed.
